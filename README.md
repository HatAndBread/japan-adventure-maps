# Todo

* Need someone with an eye for design to make it look pretty ðŸ’…
* Different kinds of activities (trail running, skiing, mountain biking etc)
* Organize group rides, runs, hikes
* Integration with Strava, RideWithGPS?
* Come up with a better build procedure. Currentlty building directly to the build folder and hosting that on Heroku. Hence the huge amount of js files.
* Improve SEO
* Removal of dead code
* Improve test coverage (using rspec in the spec folder. The test folder can be removed)
* WebGL memory leak with Webkit
